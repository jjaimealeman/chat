With the explosion of ChatGPT use, I decided to search around for a shell script that I could call from my terminal.
After testing out different ones, I settled on this one: https://github.com/0xacx/chatGPT-shell-cli

It's got some image generation capabilities that I do not use, but I left them there.

I have modified and edited the hell out of it for my own personal use.

The original script saved all previous prompts to a file `~/.chatgpt_history`. But I found that after a few weeks of use, that file grew quite large. Mine was over 2,000 lines when I made this revision.

It now creates a new daily file at `~/.chatgpt_history` with the format `Y-%m-%d.txt`.

I found this method better as I can now quickly "Live Grep" search with neovim üëç

Filename example: `~/.chat_history/2023-05-02.txt`.

When prompting the first prompt of the day, this is the output:

Afterwards, this is the output:

Each prompt is now also saved along with the response. I found this format to be easier to read.

All prompt responses piped out to `xclip -selection clipboard`, so I can quickly and easily paste elsewhere.
